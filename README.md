# Live International COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data from the [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) website. It includes web scraping to extract live data, followed by analysis and visualization using various Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to provide live visualizations of COVID-19 data, allowing users to stay updated with the latest information on cases, deaths, recoveries, and testing across different countries.

### Features

- Web scraping of live COVID-19 data from Worldometer.
- Analysis of total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, total recoveries, active cases, critical cases, total tests, and total population.
- Visualization of COVID-19 statistics using bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
- Dynamic visualization updates with each run to reflect the latest data.

## Code Details

The code is provided in the Jupyter Notebook format (`Live_International_Covid_19_Data_Analysis.ipynb`). It's developed using Python and relies on various libraries for web scraping, data manipulation, and visualization.

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed to run the code:
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `matplotlib`
- `plotly`
- `pandas`

## Usage

To run the notebook and visualize the latest COVID-19 data:
1. Open the notebook and execute each cell sequentially.
2. The web scraper will fetch the latest data from the Worldometer website.
3. The extracted data will be analyzed and visualized using different charts.
4. Ensure an active internet connection to fetch live data from the website.

## Note

- This project is a work in progress, with constant updates and improvements to ensure accurate data visualization.
- Users are advised to run the notebook regularly to stay informed about the latest COVID-19 statistics.
